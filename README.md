Linear Regression Model
- Developed a linear regression model from scratch using NumPy, implementing all core operations without external machine learning libraries.
- Implemented backpropagation to optimize model parameters through gradient descent, minimizing mean squared error (MSE) loss.
- Gained deep understanding of the mathematical foundations of linear regression, gradients, and optimization algorithms.
